## Database:
MongoDB Atlas is being used to host the cloud databse.

To access this database, create a `.env` file containing your MongoDB credentials which start with `mongodb+srv://`: `MONGO_DB_ATLAS_CREDENTIALS`.

(Unless department field is added to catalog JSONs in scraping phase) Run `python add_department_field_to_catalogs.py`.

(Unless term offerings data is reformatted elsewhere) Run `python reformat_term_offerings.py`.

To insert/update catalog documents in the database, run `upload_catalogs_to_mongo_db.sh`.

To insert/update term offering documents in the database, run `upload_term_offerings_to_mongo_db.sh`.
